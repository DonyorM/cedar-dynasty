What's happening
* Auth through cookies
* When logged in, you can see a list of other users present (try two tabs)
* The input flashes yellow now when pending, not the page.

Key ideas
* Clojure request in dynamic scope. Clojure web server, you control it
* **extent**: Electric lambdas are DAGs/objects, they have *extent*

Novel forms
* `e/*http-request*`
* `do`

Server details
* [`electric_server_java8_jetty9.clj`](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-examples-app/blob/main/src/electric_server_java8_jetty9.clj)
